# iPod-Dock Architecture Improvement Tasks

This document contains detailed development tasks for improving the iPod-dock project architecture based on patterns learned from the mature GTKPod codebase.

## Task Overview

1. **Plugin Architecture Foundation** (3-4 days, High Priority)
2. **Repository Pattern Implementation** (2-3 days, High Priority)  
3. **FastAPI Application Refactoring** (2-3 days, Medium Priority)
4. **Configuration Validation System** (1-2 days, Medium Priority)
5. **Event System Implementation** (1-2 days, Low Priority)

## Task Assignments

Each task is designed to be completed independently by junior developers. The tasks build upon each other but can be worked on in parallel by different team members.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI knowledge
- Basic understanding of design patterns
- Git workflow familiarity

### Implementation Order

1. Start with Tasks 1 and 2 in parallel (different developers)
2. Task 3 depends on Task 2 completion
3. Tasks 4 and 5 can be done independently after Task 1

## Testing Requirements

Each task must include:
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Documentation updates
- Example usage code

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Follows existing code style
- [ ] Includes comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Has appropriate logging
- [ ] Includes type hints
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Tests pass and have good coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Next Steps

After completing these tasks, the project will have:
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Robust configuration management
- Better testability and maintainability
- Foundation for future plugin development
