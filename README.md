# ipod-dock

This project aims to sync an iPod Classic with a Raspberry Pi Zero W so music or podcasts can be uploaded over Wi-Fi.  The repository will contain scripts and a small web API to manage uploads, track listings and integration with an iPod dock.

See [research.md](research.md) for notes on the hardware setup and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for planned tasks.
